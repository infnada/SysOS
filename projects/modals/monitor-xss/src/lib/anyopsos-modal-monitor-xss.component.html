  <!-- Put modal contant here -->
  <p>
    This dashboard is about to render data from server:
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.25em;">
    <code>{{serverUrl}}</code>
  </p>
  <p>
    To protect your privacy, the dashboard will <b>check all data transferred</b> for cross site scripting (XSS).
    <br/>This is CPU intensive, so your browser might be a bit slower.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you <b>trust</b> the remote server, you can disable XSS protection.<br/>
    In this case, any remote dashboard decoration code (javascript) will also run.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you <b>don't trust</b> the remote server, you should keep the protection on.<br/>
    The dashboard will run slower and remote dashboard decoration code will not run, but better be safe than sorry...
  </p>
